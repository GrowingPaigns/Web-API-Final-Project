# Gym Website and Database - Web-API-Final-Project

This repository contains code for a front-end website. Included is some functionality and stylings built using the React library. The files found within this repo in no way will function on their own to create a front end website. Instead, the files are programs which I spent a large amount of my time creating during the last sprint of the semester. 

### Explanation of Content:

***These are only pieces of the whole front-end final product.*** There will also not ever be any backend code included in this repository to protect future work that we are going to do on the project, while also preserving the security methods painstakingly implemented by one of our engineers.

Unfortunately, in its current state there is no way to easily show off the functionality of the program. In lieu of this, the video below served as our final presentation for the semester, and it explains in depth the functionality of the site. In the last **5 minutes** of the video there is a demo which shows off the state of the site at the end of the semester (05/10/23)

Some of the team is planning to meet again soon to continue iterating upon the project in the hopes of getting it to a production worthy state by Fall of 2023. As this project continues, this repo will be updated with links to future versions.
